Credit Card Validator
Overview
This is a simple C++ program that uses the Luhn Algorithm to validate credit card numbers. The program prompts the user to input a credit card number and then determines whether it's a valid credit card number or not.

Luhn Algorithm
The Luhn Algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, especially credit card numbers.

The algorithm works as follows:

Starting from the rightmost digit (the check digit) and moving left, double the value of every second digit.
If doubling a digit results in a two-digit number, add the digits of that number together.
Sum all the digits, including the ones that were not doubled.
If the total sum is a multiple of 10, the credit card number is valid; otherwise, it's invalid.
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/swetamishra123/Credit-Card-Validator.git
Compile the C++ program using a C++ compiler.

g++ main.cpp -o main
Run the program:

./main
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter credit card numbers for validation. You can exit the program by typing 'exit'.

Example Output
This program uses the Luhn Algorithm to validate a CC number.
You can enter 'exit' anytime to quit.
Please enter a CC number to validate: 4263982640269299
Valid!
Please enter a CC number to validate: 4983948596068655
Invalid!
Please enter a CC number to validate: 8957859403857785
Invalid!
Please enter a CC number to validate: 2223000048410010
Valid!
Please enter a CC number to validate: exit
Program Explanation
The program starts by prompting the user to enter a credit card number. You can exit by typing 'exit'.
It checks if the input is a valid number (only digits), and if not, it asks for input again.
It then applies the Luhn Algorithm to validate the credit card number.
The result is displayed as "Valid!" if the credit card is valid and "Invalid!" if it's not.
This program demonstrates a simple implementation of the Luhn Algorithm for credit card validation in C++.
